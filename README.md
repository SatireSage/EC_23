# Engineering Competition - 2023
**Natural Disaster Alert System**

This application was designed to gather and store user details such as name, address, phone numbers and ID's in the event of an emergency. In addition to storing information, users will be able to receive SMS messages as well as routes to the closest safe evacuation point. Ideally, governments will be the ones sending these messages and setting these routes. 

This application was built from the ground up using React.js, Python, Google Maps API and Twilio (for sending text messages) in the 2023 SFU Engineering Competition.
